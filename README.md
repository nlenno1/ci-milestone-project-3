# Introduction

This project is designed to be a space where users can share their honest reviews and opinions on films.

This is the third of four Milestone Projects that make up the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. The main requirements of this project are to *"build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain"* using: **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, **Python+Flask** and **MongoDB**

# UI & UX Development Planes

## Strategy

### Project Goals
- Develop a space where users can easily share their opinions on various films and find other users' reviews,

- Present any information in an aesthetically pleasing way,
- Handle any errors in such a way to help the user understand the issue,

### User Stories

1. I just watched a film and would like to share my opinion of it
2. I am interested in seeing a new film in the cinema and to help me decide I want to read some reviews and see a rating from my peers
3. I want to find a film to watch on streaming services but I don't have any ideas

**Casual User** - As a casual user, I want to be able to quickly search and view information about films and view and search reviews of those films that are age appropriate.

**Contributer** - As a contributer, I want to be able to do everything a Causal User can and update my profile information, create film profiles that don't exist yet, suggest changes for existing film profiles and add my reviews to any film. I want to be informed of any changes made to my account or information I added to the site.

**Admin** - As an administrator, I want to be able to Create, View, Edit and Delete all Film Profiles, User Reviews and Moderate all content provided by Users and View, Change User Tier or Delete User Accounts

User Permissions will be split into 3 Tiers :
