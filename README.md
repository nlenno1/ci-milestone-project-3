This is the third of four Milestone Projects that make up the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. The main requirements of this project are to *"build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain"* using: **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, **Python+Flask** and **MongoDB**

- Build a responsive app using the Mobile First design principle,
- Present any information in an aesthetically pleasing way,
- Handle any errors in such a way to help the user understand the issue,

### Business Goals

3. I want to find a movie to watch I don't have any ideas
4. I can't remember if I have watched a movie or not but I want to be able to check to save myself time
5. I want to keep track of how many movies I have left to watch in a series before the next film is released

![Importance Viability Graph](readme_assets/importance_viability_chart.png)

Having performed this analysis, I decided to remove features M, K, G, I, H and E from this production release due to many factors including time limitations

Feature R (Links to socials) has been left in due to its simplicity.
